Hi! I'm David. I like to build things, solve puzzles and steal memes to share them.

I'm on the path to become a front-end developer.

For the moment I'm kinda good with HTML and CSS and currently learning JS, (yes I know whats the difference between var, let and const, or atleast I think so). I'm looking to build experience by making and hopefully colaborating in exiting projects with experienced developers, so if you have anything I can help with, feel free to [contact me](davidhage@hotmail.com).
